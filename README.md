## Summary of Project Idea & Implementation

Competing in Datathon provided me with invaluable experience in analyzing statistical models and graphs derived from predefined data sets. I honed my skills in model fitting using sophisticated algorithms and gained proficiency in classification techniques by interpreting complex data figures. 

Additionally, I applied machine learning to predict the taste preferences of red wine accurately, utilizing three primary methods to enhance the robustness and precision of my analyses. This experience not only deepened my analytical capabilities but also enriched my understanding of practical data application in real-world scenarios.

### Three most important methods used:
**1.** **Linear Regression** <br />
**2.** **EDA Exploratory Data Analysis** <br />
**3.** **Classification Regression with Machine Learning Models** <br />
